This is my Rock, Paper, Scissor project for The Odin Project

I wrote a program that let the user play 5 rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissor 
against the computer.

All scores will tally at the end and will let the user know the winner or loser of the game.

This first project was challenging, but it was good for practicing my 
problem solving skills. I still have trouble with dividing a big problem into
small chunks. My skills will improve with time.
